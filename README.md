# DI
Three folders contain DLLs of frameworks I've been analyzing.
In the last folder we have the application which is a Console Application written in C#.
To start it is best to use Visual Studio 2012.

You can just start it go through the process of defining which kind of tests and how many of them you want to run.
When you're finished you can look for the results in the debug folders in two textual files for two different types of analysis.

I've been working on this project as a part of my masters project on Faculty of electrical engineering and computing in Zagreb.
